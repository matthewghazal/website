	<h2>My Interests</h2>
		<p>I'm interested in lots of things, including science, technology, film, politics, and more. Here's a brief overview!</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Science & Tech</h3>
		<p>One of my favorite things to do in my free time is watch YouTube videos about the latest scientific discoveries or technological innovations. Another thing I'm really interested in is infrastructure and logistics (which I think fall under the umbrella of science). A YouTube channel called Wendover Productions, for example, has really peaked my interest recently. You can check out their video on the interstate highway system (my personal favorite video of theirs) <a href="https://youtu.be/SR7BA3xEmDo">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Film</h3>
		<p>While I don't watch movies nearly as much as I used to, I'm still a big fan of filmmaking and I love watching unique movies that challenge conventions. Some of my favorites include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2001: A Space Odyssey</li>
			<li>Eyes Wide Shut</li>
			<li>Uncut Gems</li>
			<li>Everything Everywhere All At Once</li>
			<li>There Will Be Blood</li>
			<li>In The Mood For Love</li>
			<li>Before Sunrise</li>
		</ul>

	<br>
	
	<h3>Social Media</h3>
	<p>There's a lot of social media websites I really like. Twitter and instagram are probably the ones I visit the most, but I also use reddit (typically for finding the best of a certain product or getting other kinds of info) and I used to use Tik Tok a lot (I deleted it because it was too addicting).</p>
	<p>I also enjoy following social media platforms growth. I'm always interested in what features they're adding or expirementing with, as well as examining their design changes and how that affects user experience. I think this relates to my interest in design and logistics in general.</p>
